<!-- <h2 style="font-weight: bolder">About me</h2>
Greetings! I am a first year Computer Science PhD student at [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/), where I am co-supervised by [Prof. Shuo Wang](https://phd-shuowang.weebly.com/), Prof. Grant Wilson and Dr. Schoener Holger. Before that, I graduated from the [Australian National University](https://https://www.anu.edu.au/) with Master of Computing in 2022, advised by [Dr. Melina Vidoni](https://melvidoni.rbind.io/#about). I received my B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from the [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](https://english.njust.edu.cn/) in 2019, advised by Dr. Jun Han and Dr. Yi Ou. 


I am passionate about a wide range of topics in CS, including both method development and applications. My current focuses are on (1) machine learning topics, such as domain/model adaptation, transfer learning. (2) data stream topics, such as data uncertainty, online learning. (3) machine learning application in complex real-world data (e.g., time series, text, building, mechanical structure). 20240802 version -->

Greetings! I am a second year Computer Science PhD student at [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/), where I am co-supervised by [Dr. Shuo Wang](https://phd-shuowang.weebly.com/), Dr. Grant Wilson and Dr. Schoener Holger (Siemens). Before that, I graduated from the Australian National University and Nanjing University of Science and Technology in 2022 and 2019.


I am passionate about a wide range of topics in CS, including time series forecasting, domain adaptation, LLM, and multi-modal learning. My current main focus is leveraging text data for time series forecasting. If you are also interested in this topic, feel free to email me anytime.


<h2 style="font-weight: bolder">Current Research Focuses</h2>

<!-- - Statistical ensemble representation of dynamic clusters and restructuring surfaces in catalytic conditions.
- Development of global optimizers with grand canonical and multi-objective functionality for structure search of crystals, clusters, and surfaces.
- Realistic modeling of electrocatalytic interface to understand the roles of pH, electrode potential, solvation, and electrolyte additives.
- Direct and inverse design of functional molecules and materials for CO$_2$ capture and electroreduction. -->



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
